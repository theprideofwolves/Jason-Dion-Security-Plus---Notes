#### Acquisition and procurement
Acquisition
- process of obtaining goods and services
Procurement
- Entire process that leads up to acquiring goods and services
Different purchase options
**Company credit cards** can be used for all minor purchases on behalf of the org.
**Individual purchase** entails employees buying on the company's behalf and later seeking reimbursement from their employer.
**Purchase orders** or PO, formal doc issued by the purchasing department that authorizes a specific purchase.

#### Mobile asset deployments
Bring your own device - BYOD
- Personal devices are used for work
- Security challenge
- cant update or manage on command
Corporate owned, personally enabled - COPE
- Company provides the device
- can be used for both personal and professional use.
- cars and stuff as well
- nest security
Choose your own device - CYOD
- middle ground for byod and cope
- can choose devices from a specific list
- high costs
- data privacy concern
When making a decision about the above three, consider:
- Costs
- Security
- Employee satisfaction
#### Asset management
Refers to the systematic approach to governing and maximizing the value of items an entity is responsible for throughout their lifecycle
Assets should be **classified and categorized**:
- classification based on function, value or other relevant parameters determined by the org
**Monitoring and tracking** ensure proper accountability and optimal use of each asset.
**Asset tracking** involves maintaining inventory with asset specifications, locations, assigned users and relevant details.
**Enumeration** involves identifying and counting assets
By regularly conducting enumeration, orgs can:
- Maintain accurate inventory
- Detect unauthorized devices
- Inform software update decisions
- Address security vulnerabilities
**Mobile device Management** - MDM lets orgs securely oversee employee devices ensuring policy enforcement, software consistency and data protection.
#### Asset disposal and decommissioning
Proper procedures should be used while disposing devices.
800-88 - Guidelines for media sanitization has guidelines that one can follow for disposal. Such as:
 - Sanitization
	 - Thorough process of making data inaccessible and irretrievable
	 - Uses traditional forensic methods
	 - Some methods include:
		 - Overwriting multiple times
			 - Data is obfuscated.
		 - Degaussing
			 - strong magnetic field by degausser that can disrupt magnetic domains on storage devices.
		 - Encryption techniques
			 - Secure erase was used, but it was replaced by cryptographic erase
			 - Cryptographic erase destroys the keys required to decrypt the data.
			 - Cryptographic erase is quicker.
 - Destruction
	 - The physical device itself is beyond recovery or reuse
	 - Methods used:
		 - Shredding
		 - Pulverizing
		 - Melting
		 - Incinerating
 - Certification
	 - Act of proof that data or hardware has been securely disposed of
	 - Security stance is shown by the org w certification.
	 - Compliance is achieved

#### Change management
Org's orchestrated strategy to transition from its existing state to a more desirable future state.
If existing processes are disrupted, efficiency is reduced.
Any change must be first approved.
Assessment process must be in place.
Change advisory board
- Body of reps from various parts of the org that is responsible for evaluation of any proposed changes.
Every proposed change has:
- A change owner
	- someone who initiated the request
- Stakeholder
	- Someone who has an interest in the proposed change.
	- Technical stakeholders
	- Business stakeholders
	- End user-based stakeholders
Impact Analysis
- integral part of the change management process.
- Answer the following:
	- What could go wrong?
	- immediate effects?
	- Impact on long term operations
	- Are there unforeseen challenges that might cause an issue?

#### Change Management Processes
Five main steps:
- Preparation
	- assess current state and recognize the need for transition
	- Gather necessary resources
	- Engage stakeholders
	- Ensure preparedness
- Vision for change
	-  Clear, compelling description of desired future state
	- Define future state
	- Explain reasons for change
	- Ensure vivid vision
- Implementation
	- Putting the plan into action
	- Training
	- Restructuring teams
	- Introducing new technologies
	- Continuous communication
- Verification
	- Measuring the change's effectiveness by comparing it to the initial objectives.
	- Surveys
	- Performance metrics analysis
	- Stakeholder interviews
- Documentation
	- Creating a thorough record of the entire change process
	- Reflect on past initiatives
	- Understand decisions
	- Improve practices
Areas to consider throughout the change management process:
- Scheduled maintenance windows
	- Do it in non peak hours
	- Don't disrupt services
- Creation of  a backout plan
	- predetermined strategy to rollback
- testing of results
	- Validates the change
- Use of Standard operating procedures (SOPs)
	- Step by step instruction
	- guides the carrying out of a specific task to maintain consistency and efficiency

#### Technical implications
Technical implications of changes include:
- Allow and deny lists
	- Used generally in firewalls etc.
	- Allow list has list of permitted entities
	- Deny list has list of prevented entities. 
- Restricted activities
	- activities restricted due to its impact
- Downtime
	- compare benefits and impacts coz of downtime
- Service and application restarts
	- Disruptions may be caused/
	- Compare pros and cons
- Legacy application
	- Sensitive to changes
	- less supported compared to modern systems
- Dependencies
	- Everything is linked together
	- Map them out before starting a change.

#### Documenting changes
Provides:
- clear history of what, when and why for accountability and future reference 
Should ensure:
- Version control is occurring
	- ensures there is no chaos
	- tracks and manages changes
	- can revert back incase of problem
	- centralized place for stability
- Proper documentation updates are performed
	- Diagrams and snapshots must be updated all the time
	- Should reflect the current state of the system.
- Maintenance of various associated records is completed
	- Maintain all records regarding the change.
