#### Identifying Vulnerabilities
Spotting weakness
Methods
- Vulnerability Scanning
	- Prioritize
	- Patch
	- Mitigate
	- Nessus, openVas etc.
- Application Security Techniques
	- securing during development
	- SAST, DAST and package monitoring
- Penetration testing
	- simulate real-world attack on the system
- Security and process auditing
	- conducting comprehensive reviews of all assets
	- Steps
		- Planning
			- track vulns and deploy fixes
		- Testing
			- test patches in controlled environments
		- Implementing
			- implement patches
		- Auditing
			- verify patch implementation

#### Threat Intelligence Feeds
Continual process used to understand the threats faced by an organization.
Intelligence sources include
- Context
- Mechanisms
- Indicators
- Implicators
- Actionable Information
Server side attacks are rare as they are tough.
Attackers focus on client side attacks.
TIF is a continuous stream of data related to potential or current threats to an organization's security.
- New malware signatures
- Indicators of compromise
- Malicious IP addresses
- URLs
Can gather data from
 - OSINT
 - Proprietary of third party feeds
 - Information sharing organizations.
 - The dark web
#### Responsible Disclosure Programs
Ethical practice where a security researcher discloses information about vulnerabilities in a software, hardware or online service.


#### Analyzing Vulnerabilities
Steps:
- Confirmation
	- True positive
		- real vuln correctly identified
	- False positive
		- no vuln but flagged
	- True negative
		- no vuln not identified any
	- False negative
		- Most serious
		- vuln exists, but not found
- Prioritization
	- CVSS scoring
	- Ease of exploitation
	- magnitude of impact
	- importance of affected system
- Classification
	- Use CVE 
	- Classify based on:
		- Type of threat
		- impact
		- systems affected
- Organizational Impact
	- Impact on particular org.
- Exposure Factor
	- quantifiable metric
	- exact percentage of an asset that might get damaged.
- Risk Tolerance
	- level of risk org is willing to accept.

#### Conducting Vulnerability Scans


#### Assessing vulnerability scans


#### Vulnerability Response and Remediation
Strategies that identify, assess, and address vulnerabilities in a system or network to strengthen an organization's security posture
- Patching
- Purchasing cybersecurity insurance policies
- Network segmentation
- Implementing compensating controls
- Granting exceptions and exemptions

#### Validating Vulnerability Remediation
Validate if vulnerability is remediated by:
- Rescans
	- Schedule automatic rescans
	- Use comprehensive scans
	- Replicate initial scan conditions
- Audits
	- Maintain documentation to make auditing efficient.
- Verification
	- Test the system for desired effects.
		- Penetration test
		- User verification
		- Feedback Loops
Holistic testing
Continuous monitoring
External auditors.
#### Vulnerability Reporting
Process of documenting and communicating details about security weaknesses identified in software or systems to the individuals or organizations responsible for addressing the issue.
Internal reporting
- Identification, documentation and communication of the organization's vulnerabilities within the organizational structure of the organization.
External reporting
- Involves discussions with the vendors, partners, customers or the public at large depending on the specific vulnerability involved.
- Sharing with vendor
- Sharing with CVE
Responsible Disclosure reporting
- Bug bounties
- Address the issue to the dev
- Include
	- Methods used to exploit
	- potential impact
	- mitigations recommended
Vulnerability reports must be kept confidential.
