#### Risk assessment frequency
Regularity at which risk assessment is conducted.
4 types
- ad-hoc
	- When needed.
- Recurring 
	- Annually, quarterly etc.
- One time 
	- Conducted for specific purposes
	- not repeated
	- ad hoc may be repeated incase of same situation, but one time are done for specific project
- Continuous
	- Ongoing monitoring
Depends on organizational needs and standards.
#### Risk Identification
First step in RA.
Identify what when and where and how.
Techniques used:
- Brainstorming
- Checklists
- interviews
- Scenario analysis
Business Impact Analysis
- involves evaluating effects of disruption to the business and its operations
Determine
- Recovery time objective - RTO
	- maximum acceptable length of time that can elapse before the lack of a business function severely impacts the organization.
- Recovery point objective - RPO
	- maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time
- Mean time to repair - MTTR
	- average time required to repair a failed component or system
- Mean time between failures - MTBF
	- average time between failures
	- higher time is reliable

#### Risk register
key tool in risk management, featuring key risk indicators, risk owners and risk thresholds.
Also known as risk logs.
Documents everything regarding a risk.
A risk register contains several key areas:
- Risk description
	- Describe the risk
	- clear and precise
- Risk outcome
	- Result of risk
- Risk impact
	- Consequences if risk happens
	- uses a scale
- Risk level/threshold
	- Determined by combining the impact and likelihood
- Risk likelihood
	- chance of occurring
- Cost
	- financial impact
	- or cost of mitigation

Risk appetite
- willingness to embrace or retain specific types and levels of risk to fulfill its strategic goals
- types
	- Expansionary risk appetite
		- Org open to more risk in hopes of greater returns
	- Conservative risk appetite
		- Org favors less risk, even if it leads to lower returns
    - Neutral risk appetite
	    - Balance between risk and return
Risk impact
- 
Risk acceptance/tolerance
- org's willingness to deal with uncertainty in pursuit of their goals
Risk likelihood
Risk level
Risk outcome

Key risk indicators and Risk owners
KRI
- Predictive metrics used by orgs to signal rising risk levels in diff parts of org
Risk owners
- Person or group responsible for managing the risk
#### Qualitative risk analysis
Method of assessing risk
based on impact and likelihood
Subjective to expertise of the team

#### Quantitative risk analysis
Objective and numerical
SLE - Single loss expectancy
- Monetary value expected to be lost in single event
- value of asset multiplied by EF (value x EF)
ARO - Annual Rate of Occurrence
- Frequency of threat occurrence in a year
ALE - Annualized loss expectancy
-  expected annual loss from a risk
- SLE x ARO
EF - Exposure factor
- Proportion of an asset that is lost in an event.
- 0-100%

#### Risk management strategies
Transfer
- Shift risk to another party
- Insurance etc.
- Contract indemnity clause - a contact agreement where one party agrees to cover other's harm, liability or loss stemming from the contract.
Accept
- No steps taken against the risk
- No impact
Exceptions are used - letting an org not follow a standard under specific conditions
Avoid
- Completely eliminate the specific risk by altering plans
Mitigate
- Taking steps to decrease the likelihood or impact
#### Risk monitoring and reporting
Final step of the process.
Involves continuous tracking and logging.
Residual risk - likelihood and impact after managing the risk
Control risk - assessment of effectiveness of security measure overtime
Report is important for:
- Informed decision making
- Risk mitigation
- Stakeholder communication
- Regulatory compliance
