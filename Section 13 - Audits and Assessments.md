#### Internal Audits and Assessments
Internal audits
- evaluation of effectiveness of internal controls, compliance and integrity of IT systems and processes
- Data protection
- Network security
- Access Controls
- Incident response
**Compliance requirements** ensure that IT systems and security practices meet established standards.
**Audit committee** is a group of people responsible for supervising the org's audit and compliance functions
Internal assessments
- in-depth assessments on vulnerabilities and versions and stuff
	- Self assessment
		- Internal review
- thread modeling exercises
- Scanning tools and manual testing
- Evaluating impact
- Recommend mitigation strategies

#### Performing an internal assessment
Checklist depends on your own org.
For e.g:
MCIT - Minnesota counties intergovernmental trust
- Yes or no questions in the checklist.

#### External audits and assessments
External audits
- evaluation carried out by external entities
- GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS compliance is checked depending on the org.
External assessment
Detailed analysis by independent entity.
Types:
- Risk assessment
- Vulnerability Assessment
- Threat assessment
Regulatory compliance
- Steps taken by org to comply with laws and policies.
- NIST Framework is widely used.
Examination
- Comprehensive IT infra inspections conducted by external entities.
- Review policies, procedures, controls and address weaknesses.
- Industry specific examinations are also done.
Independent third party audits
- Offers validation of security practices, fostering trust with customers, stakeholders and regulatory authorities
- GDPR, PCIDSS

#### Performing an external assessments
Checklist depends on org's own:
- Governance
- Risk
- Compliance practices


#### Penetration testing
Types of penetration testing
- Physical Penetration testing
	- testing locks, access cards, cameras etc.
- Offensive pentesting
	- Proactive approach involving use of attack techniques similar to real cyber threats to find weaknesses in a system
- Defensive pentest
	- Reactive approach
	- Focus on mitigation and incident response and improving incident response times
- Integrated pentest
	- Purple teaming
	- Offensive and defensive teams work together
	- Weaknesses are exploited by red team and mitigations are performed by blue team.

#### Reconnaissance in pentesting
Initial phase of a pentest
Gather info about target
Active recon
- Engage w target directly
- Higher risk of detection
Passive recon
- Gather info without direct interaction
- OSINT
Environments of a pentest
- Known environment
	- Details of the environment are available
- Partially known environment
	- Limited knowledge of the environment
- Unknown environment
	- No info about target system
	- Finds everything during pentest.

#### Performing a basic pentest
Metasploit
- Pentesting framework
- Has powerful tools


#### Attestation of findings
process that involves formal validation by entity regarding a specific info.
used in internal and external assessments
Important to confirm if findings are valid.
Difference between pentest report and attestation of findings?
Attestation includes evidence.
Software attestation, Hardware attestation, system attestation are for integrity checking of the org
Integrity, validity and legitimacy is checked.
Internal and external audit attestations include:
- Accuracy of financial records
- Effectiveness of risk management strategies
- Adherence to internal policies and procedures
Attestations are used to build trust and reputation among creditors, investors etc.
