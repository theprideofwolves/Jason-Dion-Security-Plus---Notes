#### Fences
 - Structure that encloses an area
 - Visual barrier
 - Physical barrier
 - Delay intruders and alert guards
 - Protect against:
	 - Trespassing
	 - Theft
	 - Vandalism
	   Unauthorized facility access.
#### Bollard
- Anti terrorism devices
- Used to restrict vehicles
- Visual reminder to not park vehicles
- Deterrent
#### Attack with brute force
- Violent method
- Forcible entry
	- Physically breaking doors or windows or glass cutting
- Tampering security devices
	- Blinding cameras etc.
- Confronting security personnel
	- Using weapons
- Ramming a barrier with a vehicle
	- Using motorized vehicle to break in.

#### Surveillance systems
Organized strategy designed to observe an area. The categories are:
 - Security Guards
 - Cameras
	 - PTZ - Pan tilt Zoom
 - Sensors
	 - Infrared sensors
		 - Radiation emitted by warm bodies like humans or animals
	- Pressure sensors
		 - By weight
	- Microwave sensors
		- Detect movement by emitting microwave pulses and measuring their reflection off moving objects
	- Ultrasonic sensors
		- Uses echolocation like a bat.
 - Lighting
#### Bypassing Surveillance Systems
 Methods used by attackers:
 - Visual obstruction
	 - Tape over a lens
 - Blinding Sensors and cameras
	 - Sudden burst of light on lens
 - Acoustic interference
	 - Jamming or playing loud music
 - Electromagnetic interference
	 - Jamming surveillance system.
 - Physical environment attack
	 - Tampering with security systems
Methods to be safe:
- Tamper alarms
- backup power supplies
- Encrypt frequencies
#### Access control vestibules
Double door system, one door opens at a time.
Paired with access badges to improve security.
Access badges are equipped with the following technology:
- Radio frequency identification(RFID)
- Near-field Communication(NFC)
- Magnetic strips(back of credit card)
- Badges can be programmed for different roles.
- Action is logged each time badge is used.
- Guards are also placed even if badges are used.
	- Visual deterrent
	- Assistance
	- Check identity
	- Response
#### Door locks
Primary barrier, used to restrict entryways.
More complex types are available:
- Wireless signals
- Unique codes to log who is coming in
- Biometric
The acceptance and rejection rates of biometrics are a challenge.
- False acceptance rate(FAR)
	- User is authenticated as valid but he doesn't have access.
	- Increasing sensitivity of scanners to bring FAR to zero
- False Rejection Rate(FRR)
	- As important as FAR.
	- Legit user not given access
**Balancing Equal error rate(ERR) is the key.**
- also called crossover error rate(CER)
- lower the CER better the lock.
Many locks have MFA.
A cipher lock provides excellent protection using a mechanical locking mechanism with push buttons that are numbered and require a person to enter the correct combination in order to open that door.
#### Access badge cloning
RFID and NIC can be easily cloned.
Access badge cloning refers to copying data from an RFID or NFC card or badge onto another card or device.
Steps to clone an access badge:
1. Scanning
	- Using RFID or NFC reader to capture data from original badge
	- 1-2 inches for NFC badge and 2-10 inches for RFID badge
	- Range can double with a stronger antenna.
2. Data Extraction
	- Extract relevant authentication credentials
3. Writing to a new card
	- Use tools to write data to a new blank RFID or NFC card
4. Using a cloned access badge
	- Using the card.
Physical security can be easily compromised
How to stop?
- Advanced encryption
- MFA - not just card
- Regularly update security protocols
- Educate users
- Use shielding wallets - cant read cards
- Monitor and audit access logs
