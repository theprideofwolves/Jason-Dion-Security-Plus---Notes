Any software designed to infiltrate a computer system without the user's knowledge.
After infecting, malware needs to create:
- Threat Vector
	- Specific method used by an attacker to infiltrate a victim's machine
		- Unpatched software
		- Installing code
		- Phishing campaign
		- Other vulnerabilities
- Attack vector
	- Means by which an attacker gains access to the target computer and infects it. Superset of threat vector.
#### Viruses
Malicious code that runs on a machine without user's knowledge. Infects the computer whenever the file is run. Can replicate upon clicking.
Types:
- Boot sector
	- Stored in first sector of memory. Runs before OS boots up.
- Macro
	- Embedded in other files such as docs, ppt etc.
- Program
	- .exe files
- Multipartite
	- Combination of boot sector and program virus
	- Runs each time the OS boots.
- Encrypted
	- Hides itself
- Polymorphic
	- Advanced version of encrypted
	- Changes code each time it is executed
- Metamorphic
	- Rewrites itselfentirely before infecting a file.
- Stealth
	- technique to avoid detection of a virus.
	- Modifying payload
	- encrypting content
- Armor
	- Layer of protection to confuse program or person trying to analyze.
- Hoax
	- Technical social engineering
	- No actual virus initially.
#### Worms
Self replicating and self propagating.
Takes advantages of vulnerabilities in the system.
Consumes resources and can cause DOS.
#### Trojans
Malware disguised as desirable software.
- Remote Access Trojan(RAT)
	- Backdoors for data exfiltration
#### Viruses and Trojans
#### Ransomware
Type of malicious software that blocks access to computer data until a payment is made.
Best practices
- Conducting regular backups
- Installing regular software updates
- Providing security awareness training
- Implementing multi-factor authentication for the systems.
#### Zombies and Botnets
Zombie is a compromised system.
Botnet is a collection of zombie.
Attacker controls the zombies using the C2 - Command and Control node.
Common use is DDOS.

#### Rootkits
Software Designed to get admin level access. Digs deeper.
Each system has 3 levels of rings
- Ring 3 - User account
- Ring 2
- Ring 1 - admin account
- Ring 0 - Kernel mode
DLL Injection - Runs arbitrary code within the address space of anoter process by force loading dynamic link library.
- OS doesnt even know that malicious code is rnning
- Uses Shim - Shim is a software code that is placed between two components and redirects them.
Use live linux boot solutions to remove rootkits.

#### Backdoors and Logic Bombs
Remove Access Trojans are used to establish a backdoor in a system.
Easter egg - used as joke- insecure - silly feature
Logic bombs are malicious code inserted into a program, and this code only executes when certain conditions have met.

#### Keylogger
Software or hardware - records keystrokes.
Update regularly
Check premises of your hardware
Antivirus scans.
MFA
#### Spyware and bloatware
Spyware
- Designed to gather data
- Bundled with other software
- Gets installed without the user's knowledge
Bloatware
- Preinstalled
- Takes up resources.
- New security vulnerabilities may come up in these new softwares.
- To clean
	- Uninstall
	- Clean operating system installation

#### Malware Attack Techniques
Fileless malwares dont leave much evidence behind.
How do they work?
- Stage 1 Dropper or downloader
	- Dropper initiates other malware forms within a payload on an infected host.
	- Downloader retrieves additional tools post the initial infection facilitated by a dropper.
	- Shellcode encompasses lightweight code meant to execute an exploit on a given target.
- Stage 2 Downloader
	- Download and install a remote access trojan to conduct command and control on the victimized system.
- Actions on objectives.
- Concealment
Malware can be delivered in many ways:
- Code injection
- DLL sideloading
- Masquerading
- Process hollowing
- DLL Injection
#### Indications of Malware Attacks
9 common indicators:
- Account lockouts
	- Multiple login attempts
- Concurrent session utilization
	- One active session at any given time.
- Blocked content
	- Increase in blocked content usage
- Impossible travel
	- geographical locations in short amount of time
- Resource consumption
	- Using up significant amount of resources without nay legit task
- Resource inaccessibility
	- Ransomware
- Out-of-cycle logging
	- Logs generated at odd hours.
- Missing logs
	- Logs deleted by attacker to hide their tracks
- Published or documented attacks
	- Someone else publishing an aritcle of what happened to us. The italian boutique hotels case. LOL
