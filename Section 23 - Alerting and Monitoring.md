#### Monitoring Resources
Observation of computer systems including utilization of resources.
Baseline
- Established performance metrics and data points for standard behavior of a system, network or application
System monitoring
Application monitoring
Infrastructure monitoring
Used to:
- Identify potential issues
- Ensure performance optimization

#### Alerting and Monitoring Activities
Log aggregation
- Collecting logs from various locations and correlating them.
- Can monitor performance
- Identify bottlenecks
- Make informed decisions
- Forensic analysis
- Some compliance policies require maintenance of logs
Alerting
- involves setting up notifications to inform relevant stakeholders when specific events or conditions occur.
- Emails, text messages or push notifications
- Helps in
	- Issue resolution
	- Incident detection
	- Compliance
Scanning
- Regularly examining systems
- Tools
	- Nessus, OpenVAS, Qualys
- Types
	- Vulnerability scans
	- Configuration scans
	- Code scans
Reporting
- generating summaries of found data
Archiving
- Storing data for longer periods of time for future use.
Alert Response and remediation or validation
- involves taking appropriate actions in response to alerts and ensuring that the identified issues have been effectively addressed.
- Investigating
- Remediation
- Validation
Quarantining
- isolating a system to prevent further spreading
Alert tuning
- adjusting alert parameters to reduce errors, false positives and to improve the overall relevance of the alerts being generated by a given system

#### Simple Network Management Protocol
- SNMP is an Internet protocol for collecting and organizing information about managed devices on IP networks and for modifying that information to change device behavior
- SNMP set(updating new value), SNMP get(get data), SNMP trap(from agent regarding an event or fault)
- SNMP trap messages are encoded in 2 types
	- Granular
		- unique objective identifier(OID) to distinguish each message as a unique message being received
		- OIDs are collected and stored in MIB - Management information base
	- Verbose
		- contains all info about given alert
	- SNMP traps are stored in key-value pairs known as variable binding
	- 3 versions of SNMP
		- SNMPv1, SNMPv2, SNMPv3 - Low to high security
SNMPv3
- security enhanced
- uses AES on supported hardware/firmware

#### Security Information and Event Management
Provides real time or near real time analysis of security.
correlates logs into a centralized database.
SIEM deployment types
- Software
- Hardware appliances
- Outsourced managed service
SIEM can be agent based or agentless depending on how you log the data.
Agent
- installed on each system
- SIEM collects data from agent
- Clear
Agentless
- SIEM uses SNMP to collect data
- Less clear
Best practices
- Log all relevant events and filter irrelevant data
- Establish and document scope of events
- Develop use cases to define a threat
- Plan incident response for a threat or event
- Establish a ticketing system to track events
- Schedule regular threat hunting
- Provide auditors and analysts an evidence trail

#### Data from Security Tools
Can Rely on SIEM to consolidate data from different sources
Different sources include:
- Antivirus software
- Data Loss Prevention Systems
- Network Intrusion Detection/Prevention systems
- Firewalls
- Vulnerability Scanners

#### Security Content Automation and Protocol
SCAP - suite of open standards that automate vulnerability management, measurement, and policy compliance for systems in an organization.
Developed by NIST
Automates
- Vulnerability scanning
- Configuration checking
- Software inventory
3 main languages used with SCAP:
- OVAL - Open vulnerability and Assessment Language
	- XML scheme for describing system security states and querying vulnerability reports and information
- XCCDF - Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format
	- XML scheme for developing and auditing best practice configuration checklists and rules
- ARF - Asset Reporting Format 
	- XML scheme for expressing info about assets and the relationships between assets and reports
3 methods of asset enumeration:
- CCE - Common configuration and enumeration
	- Scheme for provisioning secure config checks across multiple sources
- CPE - Common platform Enumeration
	- Scheme for identifying hardware devices, operating systems, and applications.
- CVE - Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
	- List of records where each item contains a unique identifier used to describe a publicly known vuln
SCAP metric system
- CVSS - Common Vulnerability Scoring System
	- Used to provide a numerical score to reflect the severity of a given vulnerability
	- 0-10
Benchmark
- Set of security config rules for some specific set of products to provide a detailed checklist that can be used to secure systems to a specific baseline.


#### NetFlow and Flow Analysis
Full capture packet - FPC
- captures entire packet including header and payload
Flow analysis
- Relies on flow collector, which records metadata and statistics rather than recording each frame that passes through the network
- Does not provide actual content
NetFlow
- Cisco developed means of reporting network flow info to a structured database
IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX)
- Defines traffic flows based on shared packets characteristics
Zeek is a tool that can monitor as well as do full packet captures.
Multi Router Traffic Grapher - MRTG
- Creates graphs showing traffic flows through the network interfaces of routers and switches

#### Single Pane of Glass
- Central point of access for all the information, tools and systems.
- Allows teams to have ta unified view for easy access to critical information, aiding informed decision-making.
- Benefits
	1. Simplifies security management, offering a unified view in detecting and responding to threats.
	2. Security teams can monitor the environment for suspicious signs like unusual traffic or failed logins
	3. Security teams can track the progress of incident response, ensuring that all required steps are taken to resolve an incident.
	4. A single pane of glass can improve the efficiency of a security operation center.
	5. A single pane of glass improves collaboration and communication within the security teams
	6.  A single pane of glass simplifies compliance with regulatory requirements for the security teams.
	Can be hardware based or software based.
	Steps to follow to implement a single pane of glass:
	- Defining the requirements
		- involves info, tools and systems the security team is going to need to effectively monitor and secure the environments.
	- Identifying and integrating data sources
		- API, webhooks, plugins, connectors etc.
	- Customizing the interface
	- Developing standard operating procedures and documentation
	- Continuously monitoring and maintaining the solution
